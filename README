bearlib
=======

A simple collection of helper routines that I use in a lot of projects.

I used to just copy the directory into each project...

yes, a build/release person was breaking *all* the rules - *sigh*

to install from git:

  cd /base/of/your/virtualenv
  
  using pip: pip install -e git+https://github.com/bear/bearlib.git#egg=bearlib

  using setuptools: python setup.py develop

to update the from-git install:

  cd /base/of/your/virtualenv
  pip install --upgrade -e git+https://github.com/bear/bearlib.git#egg=bearlib
